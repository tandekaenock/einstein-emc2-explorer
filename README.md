## 🧪 The Science Behind

### Einstein's Equation
```
E = m × c²
```
Where:
- **E** = Energy (Joules)
- **m** = Mass (kilograms)
- **c** = Speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)

### Key Constants Used
- Speed of light (c): 299,792,458 m/s
- c²: 89,875,517,873,681,764 m²/s²
- Unit conversions with scientific precision

### Real-World Comparisons
The app includes comparisons with:
- Hiroshima atomic bomb (15 kT TNT)
- Tsar Bomba (largest nuclear test)
- Annual US electricity consumption
- Everyday items (gasoline, batteries, food)
